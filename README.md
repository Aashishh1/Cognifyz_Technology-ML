|----------------------------|-------------------------------------------------------------------------------|------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| ⭐ **Task 1: Predict Restaurant Ratings** | Build a machine learning model to predict the aggregate rating of a restaurant. | Preprocess data, train a regression model, evaluate using metrics (e.g., MSE), analyze feature importance.        |
| 🍴 **Task 2: Restaurant Recommendation System** | Create a restaurant recommendation system based on user preferences.            | Preprocess data, implement content-based filtering, test recommendations, and evaluate quality.                   |
| 🥘 **Task 3: Cuisine Classification** | Develop a model to classify restaurants by their cuisines.                     | Preprocess data, train a classification model, evaluate performance, and analyze challenges or biases.             |
| 🌍 **Task 4: Location-based Analysis** | Perform a geographical analysis of restaurants.                                | Visualize restaurant distribution, group by locality, analyze statistics (e.g., ratings, cuisines), and find insights. |
